# Bank-Marketing-Analysis
This dataset includes over 40,000 records with a total of 21 columns and represents direct marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese banking institution using phone calls. The campaigns aimed to sell subscriptions to a bank term deposit.
The research has two objectives: (1) to analyze the factors influencing a customer subscribes to a term deposit and identify directions for improving the marketing target audience, and (2) to utilize machine learning to generate a predictive model for forecasting whether a customer will successfully subscribe to the term deposit.

Analysis Results:
(1) Customers aged below 30 and above 60 show a higher willingness to subscribe to the product.
(2) Occupations with significantly higher subscription rates include students and retirees.
(3) The model's accuracy rate in predicting customer subscriptions to term deposit  is 89.16%. However, due to data imbalance, precision and recall rates are lower, leading to potential bias in predictions.
(4) This dataset provides data for a single marketing campaign. To assess the performance further, it would be beneficial to compare customer conversion rates and retention rates with those of other telemarketing campaigns, if available.

這個數據集來自一家葡萄牙銀行機構通過電話進行的直接營銷活動，這個活動的目的為推銷銀行的定期存款訂閱。本數據集包含4萬多筆資料，共21個欄位。
研究的目的為二，(1)分析影響客戶訂閱定存產品的因子以及可改善行銷客群的方向(2)運用機器學習產出預測模型，預測客戶是否會成功訂閱定存產品。

分析結果 : 
(1) 年齡30歲以下、60歲以上之客群訂閱產品意願較高。
(2) 訂閱產品比例顯著較高的職業為學生和退休族群。
(3) 預測客戶訂閱定存產品的模型準確度為89.16%，但因數據不平衡緣故，影響精準度、召回率的數值較低，預測易產生偏誤。
(4) 此數據集僅提供單一活動的數據，若有其他電銷活動的結果，可檢視客戶轉換率和留存率相較起來是否顯著優異。
